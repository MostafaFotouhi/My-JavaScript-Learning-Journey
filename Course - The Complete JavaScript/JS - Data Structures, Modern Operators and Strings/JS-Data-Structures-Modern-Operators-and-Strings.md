# JS - Data Structures, Modern Operators and Strings

**📝 Tip1: Destructuring Assignment: unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.**

**📝 Tip2: We can not assign anything to a code block, and we have "SyntaxError", so to solve this issue, we must warp all into a parenthesis**

**📝 Tip3: Spread Operators: The spread (...) syntax allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected. In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.**

**📝 Tip: Only iterable objects, like Array, can be spread in array and function parameters. Many objects are not iterable, including all plain objects**
