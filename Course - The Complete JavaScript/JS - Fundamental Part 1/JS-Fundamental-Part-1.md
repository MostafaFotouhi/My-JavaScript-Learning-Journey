## Variables
- Variables are like boxes that store values in their
- The Variable's name must be descriptive that the value in theirs
- It's better to define the variable with 'const' if its value does not change
- 'let' and 'const' are block scope, which means we can't access that variable out of scope, for accessing that we should define it out of the block, then we access it everywhere

**📝 Tip2: NAN (not a number) means it's not a valid number**

**📝 Tip3: Falsy values --> 0, '', undefine, null, NAN**

**📝 Tip4: Always use '===' to comparison between two values**
