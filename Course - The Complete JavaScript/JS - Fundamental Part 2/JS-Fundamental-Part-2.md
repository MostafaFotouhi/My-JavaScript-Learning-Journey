# JavaScript Fundamental - Part 2

**📝 Tip1: We can use 'strict mode' for blocks and functions but it's better to use it at the beginning of the JS file (line 1)**

**📝 Tip2: The big difference between 'function declaration' and 'function expression' is we can call 'function declaration' before defined in the code**

## Useful Array methods
- push() : The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
- unshift() : The unshift() method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.
- pop() : The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. 
- shift() : The shift() method removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element.
- indexOf() : The indexOf() method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.
- includes() : The includes() method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false as appropriate.

**📝 Tip3: The big difference between 'Arrays' and 'Objects' is that ordering is important in the arrays but in the objects is not.**

**📝 Tip4: We can create another property for Object in the method of Object with "this" keyword.**

**📝 Tip5: We use "for loop" when we know how many times the loop wants to repeat, so if the counter didn't be importance we use the "while loop".**
