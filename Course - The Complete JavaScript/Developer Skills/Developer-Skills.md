# Developer Skills

## Problem Solving (programming) - 4 steps to solve any problem

- Make sure you 100% understand the problem. Ask the right questions to get a clear picture of the problem
- Divide and conquer: Break a big problem into smaller sub-problems
- Don't be afraid to do as much research as you have to
- For bigger problems, write pseudo-code before writing the actual code

## The Debugging Process

- Identify: Becoming aware that there is a bug
- Find: Isolating where exactly the bug is happening in code [Developer console(simple bug) - Debugger(complex code)]
- Fix: Correct the bug
- Prevent: Preventing it from happening again [Searching for the same bug - Writing tests]

## We can use "console.---()" for Bugs finding:

- console.log() : Showing the code output in log
- console.warn() : Showing the code output in warn
- console.error() : Showing the code output in error
- console.table() : Showing the code output in table

**üìù Tip1: We can use "breakpoint" for Bugs finding, In the source tab on the "browser inspect" we can select every line of code that we want, after that we must reload browser page, then the code runs until the line that we selected and give us output**

**üìù Tip2: We can use "debugger" statement for Bugs finding, We can write "debugger" in the every line of code that we want, after that the code runs until the line that we put "debugger" and give us output**
