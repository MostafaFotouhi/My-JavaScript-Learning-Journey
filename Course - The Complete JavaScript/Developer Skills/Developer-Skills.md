# Developer Skills

## Problem Solving (programming) - 4 steps to solve any problem

- Make sure you 100% understand the problem. Ask the right questions to get a clear picture of the problem
- Divide and conquer: Break a big problem into smaller sub-problems
- Don't be afraid to do as much research as you have to
- For bigger problems, write pseudo-code before writing the actual code

## The Debugging Process

- Identify: Becoming aware that there is a bug
- Find: Isolating where exactly the bug is happening in code [Developer console(simple bug) - Debugger(complex code)]
- Fix: Correct the bug
- Prevent: Preventing it from happening again [Searching for the same bug - Writing tests]
